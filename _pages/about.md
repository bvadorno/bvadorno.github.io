I’m a Senior Lecturer in Robotics (equivalent to Associate Professor) with the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering][#1] at [The University of Manchester][#2] and Sellafield / Royal Academy of Engineering Senior Research Fellow in Cooperative Legged Robots in Challenging Environments.

Before joining The University of Manchester, I was an associate professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais ([UFMG][#3]), Brazil, where I co-founded and co-led the Mechatronics, Control, and Robotics research group ([MACRO][#4]). 

I’m an IEEE Senior Member and Associate Editor for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. From 2017—2020, I was the chair of the Technical Committee on Robotics of the Brazilian Society of Automatics.

I received both a five-year BSc degree (2005) in Mechatronics Engineering and a research MSc degree (2008) in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Brasilia](https://unb.br/) (Brazil) and a PhD degree (2011) from the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/) (France).

My current research interests include both practical and theoretical aspects of robot kinematics, dynamics, and control with applications to mobile manipulators, legged robots, and cooperative manipulation systems. A more comprehensive description of my research, including videos, is in the [projects section](https://bvadorno.github.io/projects/).
