I wear several hats at [The University of Manchester][#2]. I’m a [Sellafield / Royal Academy of Engineering Senior Research Fellow](https://raeng.org.uk/news/academy-announces-latest-research-chairs-and-senior-research-fellows) in Cooperative Legged Robots in Challenging Environments <ins>and</ins> a Senior Lecturer in Robotics ([equivalent to an Associate Professor in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer)) with the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering][#1]. I'm also affiliated with the [Manchester Centre for Robotics and AI](https://www.robotics.manchester.ac.uk/) and the Centre for Robotic Autonomy in Demanding and Long-Lasting Environments ([CRADLE](https://cradlerobotics.co.uk/)).

Before joining The University of Manchester, I was an associate professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais ([UFMG][#3]), Brazil, where I co-founded and co-led the Mechatronics, Control, and Robotics research group ([MACRO][#4]). 

I’m an IEEE Senior Member and Associate Editor for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters ([IEEE RA-L](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l)).

I received both a five-year BSc degree (2004) in Mechatronic Engineering and a research MSc degree (2008) in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Brasilia](https://unb.br/) (Brazil) and a PhD degree (2011) from the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/) (France).

My current research interests include both practical and theoretical aspects of robot kinematics, dynamics, and control with applications to mobile manipulators, legged robots, and cooperative manipulation systems.
