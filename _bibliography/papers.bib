We develop a unified kinematic model that takes into account the human-robot system from a holistic point of view, and we also propose a kinematic control strategy for pHRI that comprises different levels of shared autonomy. Since the kinematic model takes into account the complete human-robot interaction system and the kinematic control law is closed loop at the interaction level, the kinematic constraints of the task are enforced during its execution. Experiments are performed in order to validate the proposed approach, including a particular case where the robot controls the human arm by means of functional electrical stimulation (FES), which may potentially provide useful solutions for the interaction between assistant robots and impaired individuals (e.g., quadriplegics and hemiplegics).},

In addition to a formal stability proof, the paper presents simulation and experimental results on the HOAP-3 humanoid robot.

In these procedures, surgeons have restricted vision to areas near the surgical tooltips, which increases the risk of unexpected collisions between the shafts of the instruments and their surroundings. In this work, our vector-field-inequalities method is extended to provide dynamic active-constraints to any number of robots and moving objects sharing the same workspace. The method is evaluated with experiments and simulations in which robot tools have to avoid collisions autonomously and in real-time, in a constrained endonasal surgical environment. Simulations show that with our method the combined trajectory error of two robotic systems is optimal. Experiments using a real robotic system show that the method can autonomously prevent collisions between the moving robots themselves and between the robots and the environment. Moreover, the framework is also successfully verified under teleoperation with tool-tissue interactions.},

The proposed pose consensus protocol has guaranteed convergence when the interaction among the agents is represented by directed graphs with directed spanning trees, which is a more general result when compared to the literature on formation control. In order to illustrate the proposed pose consensus protocol and its extension to the problem of formation control, we present a numerical simulation with a large number of free-flying agents and also an application of cooperative manipulation by using real mobile manipulators.},

	abstract = {Whenrobots physically interact with the environment, compliant behaviors should be imposed to prevent damages to all entities involved in the interaction. Moreover, during physical interactions, appropriate pose controllers are usually based on the robot dynamics, in which the ill-conditioning of the joint-space inertia matrix may lead to poor performance or even instability. When the control is not precise, large interaction forces may appear due to disturbed end-effector poses, resulting in unsafe interactions. To overcome these problems, we propose a task-space admittance controller in which the inertia matrix conditioning is adapted online. To this end, the control architecture consists of an admittance controller in the outer loop, which changes the reference trajectory to the robot end-effector to achieve a desired compliant behavior; and an adaptive inertia matrix conditioning controller in the inner loop to track this trajectory and improve the closed-loop performance. We evaluated the proposed architecture on a KUKA LWR4+ robot and compared it, via rigorous statistical analyses, to an architecture in which the proposed inner motion controller was replaced by two widely used ones. The admittance controller with adaptive inertia conditioning presents better performance than with a controller based on the inverse dynamics with feedback linearization, and similar results when compared to the PID controller with gravity compensation in the inner loop.},

To address the manipulator liability to modeling errors, uncertainties, exogenous disturbances, kinematic singularities, and their influence upon the kinematics of the end-effector pose, we adapt H-infinity techniques---suitable only for additive noises---to unit dual quaternions. The noise to error attenuation within the H-infinity framework has the additional advantage of casting aside requirements concerning noise distributions, which are significantly hard to characterize within the group of rigid-body transformations. Using dual quaternion algebra, we provide a connection between performance effects over the end-effector trajectory and different sources of uncertainties and disturbances while satisfying attenuation requirements with minimum instantaneous control effort. The result is an easy-to-implement closed-form H-infinity control design criterion. The effectiveness and performance overview of the proposed strategies are evaluated within different realistic simulated scenarios.},

	abstract = {Dual quaternion algebra and its application to robotics have gained considerable interest in the last two decades. Dual quaternions have great geometric appeal and easily capture physical phenomena inside an algebraic framework that is useful for both robot modeling and control. Mathematical objects, such as points, lines, planes, infinite cylinders, spheres, coordinate systems, twists, and wrenches are all well defined as dual quaternions. Therefore, simple operators are used to represent those objects in different frames and operations such as inner products and cross products are used to extract useful geometric relationships between them. Nonetheless, the dual quaternion algebra is not widespread as it could be, mostly because efficient and easy-to-use computational tools are not abundant and usually are restricted to the particular algebra of quaternions. To bridge this gap between theory and implementation, this paper introduces DQ Robotics, a library for robot modeling and control using dual quaternion algebra that is easy to use and intuitive enough to be used for self-study and education while being computationally efficient for deployment on real applications.},

The task relaxation method consists of defining regions of interest instead of defining the end-effector pose, which can potentially increase the robot’s redundancy with respect to the manipulation task. Tasks are relaxed by controlling the end-effector distance to a target plane while respecting suitable constraints in the task-space. We formulate the problem as a constrained control problem that enforces both equality and inequality constraints while being reactive to changes in the workspace. We evaluate the adapted framework in a simulated pick-and-place task with similar complexity to the one evaluated in the original framework. The number of plan nodes that our framework generates is 54\% smaller than the one in the original framework and our framework is faster both in planning and execution time. Also, the end-effector remains within the regions of interest and moves toward the target region while satisfying additional constraints.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach for interactive manipulation involving a human and a humanoid. The interaction is represented by means of the relative configuration between the human's and the robot's hands. Based on this principle and a set of mathematical tools also proposed in the paper, a large set of tasks can be represented intuitively. We also introduce the concept of simultaneous handling using mirrored movements, where the human controls the robot and simultaneously interacts with it by means of a common manipulated object. Illustrative experiments are performed to validate the proposed techniques.},

Event related (de)synchronization in each of the recorded electroencephalogram channels was analyzed. Event related desynchronization was present in alpha and beta bands in various areas of the cortex, including occipital, parietal, central and prefrontal areas.

	abstract = {This work addresses the task-space design prob- lem of a linear-quadratic optimal tracking controller for robotic manipulators using the unit dual quaternion formalism. The efficiency, compactness, and lack of singularity of the representation render the unit dual quaternion a suitable framework for simultaneously describing the attitude and the position of the end-effector. Motivated by the advantages of this kinematic description, we propose a new task-space linear- quadratic optimal tracking controller in order to find an optimal trajectory for the end-effector, providing a tool to balance more conveniently the end-effector error and its task- space velocity. This is possible because the kinematic control problem using the dual quaternion transformation invariant error can be reduced to an affine time-varying system. The proposed optimal tracking controller allows the compensation of trajectory induced disturbances, as well as other modeled additive disturbances and known bias. Simulation results with different design parameters provide a performance overview, in comparison with standard kinematic controllers with and without a feed-forward term, for tracking a desired reference.},

	abstract = {— This paper presents a technique for the modeling and balance control of humanoid robots based on dual quaternion algebra and the Cooperative Dual Task-Space Framework. A strategy for controlling the Center of Mass (CoM) position that takes into account the system's stability constraints is presented and validated in a realistic simulation. The results show that the presented control strategy is able to track a desired 3D trajectory for the CoM while ensuring the robot's balance, and may potentially be extended to perform bipedal locomotion. Keywords— Humanoid robots, Center of Mass (CoM), CoM control, Dual quaternion, Cooperative Dual Task-Space (CDTS). Resumo— Este artigo apresenta uma técnica de modelagem e controle de equilíbrio de robôs humanóides baseada na álgebra de quatérnios duais e no Espaço de Cooperação Dual. Uma estratégia para controlar a posição do Centro de Massa (CM), que leva em consideração as restrições de estabilidade do sistema, é apresentada e validada em um ambiente de simulação realístico. Os resultados obtidos mostram que esta estratégia de controle é capaz de realizar o rastreamento de uma trajetória 3D desejada para o CM, enquanto garante o equilíbrio do robô, e pode, potencialmente, ser estendida para a locomoção de robôs bípedes.

The control strategy is based on a cascade scheme composed of an outer loop that takes into account all DOF and an inner loop that explicitly deals with the nonholonomic constraints of the mobile base. The comparison is performed between two techniques applied at the outer loop to deal with the whole-body motion, namely a traditional approach that uses the pseudoinverse of the robot Jacobian matrix and the parsimonious control recently introduced by Gonçalves et al. [1]. Experiments on a real robot show that the parsimonious approach uses fewer actuators than the traditional approach at the expense of more abrupt control signals.},

	abstract = {In adult laparoscopy, robot-aided surgery is a reality in thousands of operating rooms worldwide, owing to the increased dexterity provided by the robotic tools. Many robots and robot control techniques have been developed to aid in more challenging scenarios, such as pediatric surgery and microsurgery. However, the prevalence of case-specific solutions, particularly those focused on non-redundant robots, reduces the reproducibility of the initial results in more challenging scenarios. In this letter, we propose a general framework for the control of surgical robotics in constrained workspaces under teleoperation, regardless of the robot geometry. Our technique is divided into a slave-side constrained optimization algorithm, which provides virtual fixtures, and with Cartesian impedance on the master side to provide force feedback. Experiments with two robotic systems, one redundant and one non-redundant, show that smooth teleoperation can be achieved in adult laparoscopy and infant surgery.},
