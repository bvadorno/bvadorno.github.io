The contact change leading to the best position on the horizon is executed, and exploration resumes. In preliminary simulations, the algorithm consistently returned paths requiring at least 20\% fewer contact changes than the state-of-the-art. Our algorithm generated 48.0\% fewer nodes than the state-of-the-art in one terrain and 0.5\% more in another, leading future work to examine the effects of specific environmental features on the number of nodes generated.},

We use the cooperative dual task-space (CDTS) framework, vector field inequalities (VFIs) and geometric primitives such as Plücker lines and planes to implement collision avoidance with the environment and preserve the integrity of the task. Simulations of the use-cases were carried out and showed that all implemented constraints were upheld through the execution of the bimanual manipulation task.},
