We develop a unified kinematic model that takes into account the human-robot system from a holistic point of view, and we also propose a kinematic control strategy for pHRI that comprises different levels of shared autonomy. Since the kinematic model takes into account the complete human-robot interaction system and the kinematic control law is closed loop at the interaction level, the kinematic constraints of the task are enforced during its execution. Experiments are performed in order to validate the proposed approach, including a particular case where the robot controls the human arm by means of functional electrical stimulation (FES), which may potentially provide useful solutions for the interaction between assistant robots and impaired individuals (e.g., quadriplegics and hemiplegics).},

In addition to a formal stability proof, the paper presents simulation and experimental results on the HOAP-3 humanoid robot. Finally, a comparison is made with a least-square method based on the pseudoinverse of the task Jacobian, showing that the proposed method indeed uses fewer joints than the classic one.},

In these procedures, surgeons have restricted vision to areas near the surgical tooltips, which increases the risk of unexpected collisions between the shafts of the instruments and their surroundings. In this work, our vector-field-inequalities method is extended to provide dynamic active-constraints to any number of robots and moving objects sharing the same workspace. The method is evaluated with experiments and simulations in which robot tools have to avoid collisions autonomously and in real-time, in a constrained endonasal surgical environment. Simulations show that with our method the combined trajectory error of two robotic systems is optimal. Experiments using a real robotic system show that the method can autonomously prevent collisions between the moving robots themselves and between the robots and the environment. Moreover, the framework is also successfully verified under teleoperation with tool-tissue interactions.},

The proposed pose consensus protocol has guaranteed convergence when the interaction among the agents is represented by directed graphs with directed spanning trees, which is a more general result when compared to the literature on formation control. In order to illustrate the proposed pose consensus protocol and its extension to the problem of formation control, we present a numerical simulation with a large number of free-flying agents and also an application of cooperative manipulation by using real mobile manipulators.},

	abstract = {Whenrobots physically interact with the environment, compliant behaviors should be imposed to prevent damages to all entities involved in the interaction. Moreover, during physical interactions, appropriate pose controllers are usually based on the robot dynamics, in which the ill-conditioning of the joint-space inertia matrix may lead to poor performance or even instability. When the control is not precise, large interaction forces may appear due to disturbed end-effector poses, resulting in unsafe interactions. To overcome these problems, we propose a task-space admittance controller in which the inertia matrix conditioning is adapted online. To this end, the control architecture consists of an admittance controller in the outer loop, which changes the reference trajectory to the robot end-effector to achieve a desired compliant behavior; and an adaptive inertia matrix conditioning controller in the inner loop to track this trajectory and improve the closed-loop performance. We evaluated the proposed architecture on a KUKA LWR4+ robot and compared it, via rigorous statistical analyses, to an architecture in which the proposed inner motion controller was replaced by two widely used ones. The admittance controller with adaptive inertia conditioning presents better performance than with a controller based on the inverse dynamics with feedback linearization, and similar results when compared to the PID controller with gravity compensation in the inner loop.},

To address the manipulator liability to modeling errors, uncertainties, exogenous disturbances, kinematic singularities, and their influence upon the kinematics of the end-effector pose, we adapt H-infinity techniques---suitable only for additive noises---to unit dual quaternions. The noise to error attenuation within the H-infinity framework has the additional advantage of casting aside requirements concerning noise distributions, which are significantly hard to characterize within the group of rigid-body transformations. Using dual quaternion algebra, we provide a connection between performance effects over the end-effector trajectory and different sources of uncertainties and disturbances while satisfying attenuation requirements with minimum instantaneous control effort. The result is an easy-to-implement closed-form H-infinity control design criterion. The effectiveness and performance overview of the proposed strategies are evaluated within different realistic simulated scenarios.},

	abstract = {Dual quaternion algebra and its application to robotics have gained considerable interest in the last two decades. Dual quaternions have great geometric appeal and easily capture physical phenomena inside an algebraic framework that is useful for both robot modeling and control. Mathematical objects, such as points, lines, planes, infinite cylinders, spheres, coordinate systems, twists, and wrenches are all well defined as dual quaternions. Therefore, simple operators are used to represent those objects in different frames and operations such as inner products and cross products are used to extract useful geometric relationships between them. Nonetheless, the dual quaternion algebra is not widespread as it could be, mostly because efficient and easy-to-use computational tools are not abundant and usually are restricted to the particular algebra of quaternions. To bridge this gap between theory and implementation, this paper introduces DQ Robotics, a library for robot modeling and control using dual quaternion algebra that is easy to use and intuitive enough to be used for self-study and education while being computationally efficient for deployment on real applications.},

The task relaxation method consists of defining regions of interest instead of defining the end-effector pose, which can potentially increase the robot’s redundancy with respect to the manipulation task. Tasks are relaxed by controlling the end-effector distance to a target plane while respecting suitable constraints in the task-space. We formulate the problem as a constrained control problem that enforces both equality and inequality constraints while being reactive to changes in the workspace. We evaluate the adapted framework in a simulated pick-and-place task with similar complexity to the one evaluated in the original framework. The number of plan nodes that our framework generates is 54\% smaller than the one in the original framework and our framework is faster both in planning and execution time. Also, the end-effector remains within the regions of interest and moves toward the target region while satisfying additional constraints.},
